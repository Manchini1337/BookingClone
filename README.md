# BookingClone

Simple MERN stack project to sharpen my programming skills. 

Application provides various functionalities, such as creating an user account, uploading images, or booking apartments.

The application has been deployed, however, it takes advantage of free hosting services such as heroku. Please keep that in mind, because that might have impact on loading times or server/db responses. 

The Heroku app can take a minute to load if it has been inactive for a long time.

## Demo

You can test the app [here.](https://manchini1337.github.io/BookingClone/)
